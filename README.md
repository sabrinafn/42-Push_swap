**Push Swap**
<br>
<br>
The Push Swap project is about implementing a sorting algorithm using stacks. The goal is to sort a list of integers with the fewest number of operations, using only the basic operations allowed on stacks.

**Key Features**:
<br>
<br>
Stacks: Two stacks are used to manage the data (a and b).

Operations: The project focuses on operations like sa, sb, pa, pb, ra, rb, rra, and rrb to manipulate the stacks.

Optimization: The challenge is to sort the integers using the minimum number of operations possible.
